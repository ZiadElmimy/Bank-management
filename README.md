# Bank management system
- this is a project that I have done after completing the CS50's Python course, and it has some functionalities like creating new accounts, generating the card with the security code and password entered by the user, and then adding all this information to a CSV file called accounts.
- after the file is added to the CSV file, you can deposit, withdraw, and check the balance of your account using the functions concerned with that.
